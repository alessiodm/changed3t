__ChangeD3t__ is a simple academic project implementing a custom trhee-frame-difference algorithm for better video change detection.
It is based on OpenCV library and you won't be able to run it without configuring properly your local environment.

*I'm not going to update the code and create a full automatic build system*, so if you're interested in this work please let me know.

Sorry for the PDF documentation in italian language, but it is as it was :) Please, contact me directly if you'd like to have a translated version.
